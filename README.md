<h1>KD Swap CF7</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  KD Swap CF7 is a WordPress plugin designed to help parents swap kindergarten spots for their children. By integrating with Contact Form 7 and Flamingo, the plugin searches user submissions for potential matches, notifying parents on the thank you page and via email if a match is found. Additionally, it automatically informs previously registered users when new matching submissions are added, facilitating easy communication between interested parties.
